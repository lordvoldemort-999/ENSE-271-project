Check in Notes:

-the customer would like if we found a way to compress the resources tab to be less sections. Seemed to prefer that over the other idea of shifting things out of the additional resources tab.

-they liked the redesigned site maps, but we did not learn which was preferred.

-they liked both the pdf/links section redesign shown and the redesign concept of the additional resources section.
